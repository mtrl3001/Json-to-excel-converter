# What Does This Code Do?
This code is a tool that helps organize and combine information stored in multiple JSON files into a single Excel file. JSON files are a common way to store structured data, and this code can handle files with complex structures, breaking them down into simple rows and columns that are easy to read and analyze.

# How Does It Work?

Collecting Your Files:
All your JSON files should be placed in one folder on your computer. These files can contain any type of data, such as reports, statistics, or records for different entities (e.g., people, organizations, or events).
Reading and Processing:

The code looks through all the JSON files in the folder.
It breaks down the data in each file, including any complex or nested information, into a format that looks like a spreadsheet with rows and columns.

Combining the Data:
After processing all the files, the code combines the information into one large dataset.

Saving the Results:
The final dataset is saved as an Excel file. You can open this file with tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to view and analyze the data.
What Do You Need to Do?

Prepare Your Files:
Put all your JSON files into a single folder.

Update the Code:
Set the folder path in the code where your JSON files are stored.
Specify where you want the final Excel file to be saved.

Run the Code:
Run the program (you may need help from someone familiar with Python if you're not comfortable running scripts).
Once itâ€™s done, the Excel file will be created in the location you specified.

# Why Is This Useful?

This tool saves you time by:
Automating the process of combining many files into one.
Handling complex data structures without requiring manual effort.
Producing an easy-to-read Excel file that you can analyze or share with others.
