# Functionality Overview
This code provides a framework for loading, processing, and analyzing multiple JSON files containing structured data. It is designed to handle data from diverse sources stored across multiple files in a directory, normalize hierarchical JSON structures into a flat format, and facilitate efficient data analysis and visualization. The code is adaptable to various use cases, such as tracking performance metrics, analyzing comparative data, or aggregating entity-specific information.

# How the Code Works
Input Data:
The code expects all JSON files to be stored in a designated directory (e.g., Documents/Data).
Each file should represent data for a distinct entity or category (e.g., a user, a project, or a system) and can include hierarchical structures.
Data Loading:

The script iterates through all files in the specified directory (and its subdirectories).
Each JSON file is read and loaded into Python, with data stored in a list or DataFrame for processing.
Data Processing:

The code extracts relevant details, such as unique entity identifiers (entity_id, entity_name) and associated attributes.
Nested JSON categories are automatically expanded using the expand_nested_categories function, which recursively flattens nested dictionaries into a tabular format.

Normalization:
The expanded data is structured into rows and columns, allowing for easier querying and analysis.
Key categories include:
Metrics: Represents performance or measurement data for the entity.
Comparative Data: Includes information about external entities or comparisons with other data points.

Combining and Exporting:
All processed data is consolidated into a single table (DataFrame).
The final table is exported to an Excel file (combined_data.xlsx) for further use.

Error Handling:
The script includes error handling to skip invalid files and log processing issues without stopping the entire process.

Customization:
Input Folder: Update the input_folder variable to the directory containing your JSON files.
Output File: Specify the desired path for the exported Excel file in the output_file variable.
Category Names: The script uses general names like metrics and comparative, but these can be customized to match your data context.

Output:
The combined data is saved as an Excel file, making it easy to share or analyze further with tools like Excel or visualization libraries.

# How to Use the Code
Prepare Your JSON Files:
Organize your JSON files in a single directory, ensuring a consistent structure for easier processing.

Set Up the Script:
Update the input_folder variable to point to the directory with your files.
Update the output_file variable with the desired path for the resulting Excel file.

Run the Script:
Execute the script to load, process, and export the data.
The script handles nested JSON structures and outputs a flattened, unified dataset.

Extend the Code:
Customize the script to add additional transformations or filters.
Integrate it with visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib or seaborn) for advanced data analysis.
Execute the script to load, process, and export the data.
The script handles nested JSON structures and outputs a flattened, unified dataset.
